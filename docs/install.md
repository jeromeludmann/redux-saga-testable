# Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Then install:

```sh
npm install --save-dev redux-saga-testable
```

or

```sh
yarn add -D redux-saga-testable
```

_Since it will only be used during the development stage, you should install it as a development dependency._
